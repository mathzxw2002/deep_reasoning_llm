🌟【Agentic AI阶梯模型详解：从基础代理到高级自主系统】🌟

🔥 当我们从使用工具的聊天机器人过渡到自治系统时，关键是要理解代理是如何在能力上演变的。

这正是Agentic AI Staircome的用武之地——一个清晰的、分层模型，用于设计和评估代理成熟度。

让我们来分解一下：

🌟 ​​𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 （基础代理：反应性执行者）​​

• 这些代理遵循规则执行结构化任务，几乎没有或完全没有自主权。

• Goal Understanding：解析指令以定义任务目标和最终目标。

• Context Awareness：维护会话状态、用户意图和任务相关环境数据。

• Short-Term Memory Access：使用最近的互动进行即时回忆，以确保连续性。

• Simple Tool Usage：基于预设规则或提示调用API或工具。

• Prompt-Guided Execution：遵循结构化提示执行逻辑驱动或基于规则的任务。

这些代理是逻辑驱动的助手——它们快、可预测，但受局限！

🚀 ​​𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 （中级代理：自适应推理者）​​

• 这里代理在行动前开始思考——它们响应反馈并通过步骤进行推理。

• Planning & Reasoning Loop：分解任务并利用规划策略步骤推理。

• Dynamic Memory Retrieval：获取相关的长期记忆或嵌入，以增强上下文。

• Trigger-Driven Actions：基于系统事件或环境触发因素发起行为。

• Self-Evaluation & Reflection：分析过去决策以改进未来行动。

• Goal Reprioritization：根据更新的输入或约束动态调整优先级。

这个级别引入了认知灵活性、内省和动态行为！

🔝 ​​𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 （高级代理：自主与涌现）​​

• 这些代理行为像数字协作者——自我驱动、情境感知且具协作性。

• Autonomous Planning & Execution：无需外部指导独立创建和执行计划。

• Multi-Agent Coordination：与其他代理协作完成复杂的分布式任务。

• Emergent Behavior Generation：通过基于适应的学习和行为产生未编程的响应。

• Environment-Embedded Interaction：在物理或数字环境中实时感知与响应。

• Self-Management System：在无人监督下独立管理记忆、目标、工具和行为。

在这个阶段，代理接近真正的自主性——能够持续行动、学习和协调！

✅ ​​𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗿𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: （为何这个阶梯模型重要）​​

• 现今的“AI代理”大多数卡在基础或早期中级阶段。但真正的Agentic AI创新需向阶梯上端迈进——向着能：

• Learn from their past：从过去学习；

• Adjust goals on the fly：动态调整目标；

• Collaborate with others：与他人协作；

• Operate autonomously in real environments：在真实环境中自主操作的系统发展。

无论你在构建AI copilot、自治研究代理或协调多代理工作流——这个阶梯就是一张地图，用于指导你的开发和评估！💪

# Agent Definition from Google

https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents

AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.

Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously; can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes. Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.

Key features of an AI agent
As explained above, while the key features of an AI agent are reasoning and acting (as described in ReAct Framework) more features have evolved over time.

Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.
Acting: The ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, plans, or external input is crucial for AI agents to interact with their environment and achieve goals. This can include physical actions in the case of embodied AI, or digital actions like sending messages, updating data, or triggering other processes.
Observing: Gathering information about the environment or situation through perception or sensing is essential for AI agents to understand their context and make informed decisions. This can involve various forms of perception, such as computer vision, natural language processing, or sensor data analysis.
Planning: Developing a strategic plan to achieve goals is a key aspect of intelligent behavior. AI agents with planning capabilities can identify the necessary steps, evaluate potential actions, and choose the best course of action based on available information and desired outcomes. This often involves anticipating future states and considering potential obstacles.
Collaborating: Working effectively with others, whether humans or other AI agents, to achieve a common goal is increasingly important in complex and dynamic environments. Collaboration requires communication, coordination, and the ability to understand and respect the perspectives of others.
Self-refining: The capacity for self-improvement and adaptation is a hallmark of advanced AI systems. AI agents with self-refining capabilities can learn from experience, adjust their behavior based on feedback, and continuously enhance their performance and capabilities over time. This can involve machine learning techniques, optimization algorithms, or other forms of self-modification.

What is the difference between AI agents, AI assistants, and bots?
AI assistants are AI agents designed as applications or products to collaborate directly with users and perform tasks by understanding and responding to natural human language and inputs. They can reason and take action on the users' behalf with their supervision.

AI assistants are often embedded in the product being used. A key characteristic is the interaction between the assistant and user through the different steps of the task. The assistant responds to requests or prompts from the user, and can recommend actions but decision-making is done by the user.
